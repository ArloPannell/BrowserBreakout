### Project Description

The purpose of this project is practice the basics of creating browser based games. It replicates the classic breakout game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made a version of this game as my final project for a C Programming class I took in the late 90's. That one was much more complicated as it used Assembly language to access the display, and C to handle everything else in the game.

- Develop file structure independently, with freedom to name classes and files freely, following BEM standards.
- Following tutorial from MDN :
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

- Utilize Git Hub for version control, file management, and deployment.
- Practice documentation skills, including creation and development of this file.
- Practice presentation skills by creating a video describng the project.
